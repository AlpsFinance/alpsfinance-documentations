Description: This smart contract is used to handle ALPS ERC20 Token Airdrop using the Merkle Tree data structure for gas efficiency.

### getMerkleRoot()

* Get the current Merkle root that is used within the Airdrop.sol smart contract

### setMerkleRoot(bytes32 \_newMerkleRoot)

* Set the Merkle root to the `_newMerkleRoot` value
* Requirements:
  * only the `owner` of the smart contract is allowed to call the function
  * `_newMerkleRoot` must not be zero value
  * `_newMerkleRoot` cannot have the same value as the current Merkle root

### claim(uint256 amount, bytes32\[] calldata proof)

* Allows claiming tokens if address is part of Merkle tree
* Requirements:
  * `amount` must be larger than 0
  * `msg.sender` never call the function (e.g. never claim the airdrop)
  * `msg.sender` must be whitelisted in the Merkle tree by verifying it using `proof`
* Emit the `Claim` event
