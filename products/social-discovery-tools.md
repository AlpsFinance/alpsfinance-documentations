# ðŸ«‚ Social Discovery Tools

Being a DeFi Fund Manager is not all about investing, it's also about getting investors to **discover YOU** (the fund managers) and **recognize your investing reputation**.&#x20;

However, fund managers tend to be not very good at these and they are undoubtedly a feat on their own aside from investing. In Alps Finance, we believe that fund managers:

* &#x20;**SHOULD:** focus most of their effort in their strength, investing and generating alpha
* **SHOULD NOT:** get distracted by active effort of searching for and get recognized by investors

In order to do so, we've built several in-app solution:

### Web3 Social Media

It is well-known that social media is a very powerful tool for people to get discovered online and establish their online presence and reputation. As a fund manager, you will be able to take advantage of the web3 social media feature by:

* Share your current/future outlook on various crypto market and DeFi strategies
* Sharing with potential investors your crypto/DeFi investment thesis
* Promote your investing reputation and brand through your alpha track record
* etc.

By integrating **Lens Protocol** onto Alps Finance, we will be offering several social media features:

* **Profile**: Social media profile represented as an NFT on Polygon Mainnet. The profile will contain several (publicly accessible) basic information that includes handles, name, bio, and profile picture. Currently, profile can only be created through [https://claim.lens.xyz](https://claim.lens.xyz).
* **Follows**: Following profile mechanism, represented by NFT on Polygon Mainnet, that allows user to follow other user's profile.
* **Publications**:&#x20;
* **Mirrors**:
* **Comments**:
* **Tags**:

### Fund Manager Rank Board

Getting discovered by investor is one thing, but getting your investing reputation recognized as an alpha fund manager is another thing. Establishing yourself in the DeFi community as an extraordinary is extremely difficult without the right infrastructure.&#x20;

As a solution, Alps Finance will be bringing **Fund Manager Rank Board** that will be curated exclusively with the help of the **scouters**, ranking the best fund managers with alpha strategies to recommend the **investors**.

Through our incentivization scheme, you'll only be able to use this feature after staking certain amounts of ALPS token to have parts of the yield rewarded to the **scouters** (after locked for 30 days) **** as an incentive to rank you and get you discovered by the investors.
