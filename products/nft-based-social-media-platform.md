# ðŸ«‚ NFT-based Social Media Platform

As a social investing platform, social media is at the heart of the appâ€™s functionality to engage with the DeFi community and learn from others about DeFi investing, creating a network effect. Investors can actively engage and interact with other DeFi investors through knowledge and idea sharing.&#x20;

The social media in our application will consist of two main functionalities:&#x20;

* **Posts**: a public channel where investors can create a public post to share their investment thesis, investment experience, etc.
* **Messaging**: a private channel in our app where investors can send messages to another investor privately.&#x20;

In addition, we will be adding DAO Investment Fund (see below) to compliment the in-app social media. The DAO Investment Fund enables investors to create DAOs to collaborate and create either partnerships (group investing), on-chain funds (crypto hedge funds), or other custom DAO structure. These collaborations will require many social interactions between the investors. By developing an in-app social media feature, it will fit nicely into our platform to serve that purpose.
