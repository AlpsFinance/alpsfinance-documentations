# üèÜ Asset Manager Leaderboard

Getting discovered by investor is one thing, but getting your investing reputation recognized as an alpha fund manager is another thing. Establishing yourself in the DeFi community as an extraordinary fund manager is extremely difficult without the right infrastructure.&#x20;

As a solution, Alps Finance will be bringing **Fund Manager Rank Board** that will be curated exclusively with the help of the **scouters**, ranking the best fund managers with alpha strategies to recommend to the **investors**. If you have a track record of consistently generating alpha, this feature will be extremely beneficial for you as fund manager as it will provide you a platform to:

* have your investing talent recognized by the investors on our platform
* get exposure to grow your investing community and AUM without wasting time marketing&#x20;

Through our incentivization scheme, you'll only be able to use this feature after staking certain amounts of ALPS token to have parts of the yield rewarded to the **scouters** (after locked for 30 days) **** as an incentive to rank you and get you discovered by the investors.
