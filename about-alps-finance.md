The ultimate goal of Alps Finance is accelerating global DeFi adoption. In order to achieve that, it is crucial for us to solve all the issues mentioned above. Our solution is to create an all-in-one social DeFi investing platform that would help users to learn, invest, and manage all their crypto assets easily. Features that will be implemented are:

Web3 Email + Social Login

Authentication is always the first step in a user's app exploration and it gives the user first impression of the app. Providing users with a good first impression is very crucial as it will determine their decision to continue using the app or not. Despite such a basic UX requirement, many dapps have continuously failed to provide a great user login experience, especially for non-technical users. Despite the numerous wallet integration that is offered on the app, it does not help much to the fact that Web3 Wallet (Metamask, Walletconnect, etc.) login generally have a bad user experience. Not only does this can be indicated when connecting a wallet to an app, but also when making transactions and signing messages. These events usually prompt numerous confirmation popups that non-technical users do not understand and creates confusion in the process.

In order to avoid the same problem and achieve our goal, we will instead implement an Email + Social Login for authentication. With Web3Auth integration, it will be possible for users to login and access their wallet address on Alps Finance using only their Email or Social Media (Google, Facebook, Twitter, etc). This authentication method will ensure that users get a familiar login and great UX when using our application to interact with various blockchains. Furthermore, through this method, weâ€™ll be able programmatically avoid multiple confusing popups when signing transactions and provide users with a smoother UX overall when investing in DeFi.

NFT-based Social Media Platform

```
As a social investing platform, social media is at the heart of the app that functions to provide users a platform to engage with the DeFi community and learn from others about DeFi investing. By having a platform for users to be able to actively engage and interact with other DeFi investors, exchange of DeFi knowledge and ideas will occur along the process. As more people are educated in the DeFi space, our ultimate goal of global DeFi adoption will be possible.

The social media in our application will consist of two main functionality: posts and messages. Posts is a public channel in our app where users can create a public post to their investment thesis, investment experience, etc. On the other hand, messages is a private channel in our app where users can send messages to another user privately.

```
In addition, since we will be adding DAO Investment Fund (see below) as one of our features, the in-app social media feature will be a perfect compliment to it. In short, the DAO Investment Fund is a feature that will allow users to create DAOs to collaborate and create either partnerships (group investing), on-chain funds (crypto hedge funds), or other custom DAO structure.

Cross-chain DeFi Aggregator

While DeFi makes information easily accessible, it is undeniable that that information is scattered all over everywhere. This in turn made tracking DeFi portfolio a huge task on itself.
